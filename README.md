Very quick and simple unique dust checker for path of exile.

Works by watching clipboard and looking up dust value by name from imported csv file
Use ctrl c ingame on a quniqe item to get dust value

Very simple error handling, should be enough to avoid trigger on random ctrl c elements

Values are ilvl 84 + 20 quality

Change the patch to where the csv file is saved.

Have fun
